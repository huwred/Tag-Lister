# Tag Lister
 This my first attempt at an Umbraco plugin. It is a tag lister/picker for Umbraco.
 
 When added to a form that has the Ummbraco.Tags control on it, the Lister will display a dropdown containg the 10 most used tags in that group.
 
 The dropdown is multiselect so you can add multiple tags to the Umbraco.Tags control all at once.
 
 Hopefully someone will find this or the code useful.
 
 
 The controller and model are in the TagList sub folder under src, the angular code is in the App_Plugins sub folder.
